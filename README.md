# Simple React Projects

These are the project files that I've made while taking Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course.

To run:

1. Clone repo
2. Open the folder of the project you want to see
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start`
   (\*For 11-worldwise: Run `npm run dev`)

Only React and Javascript logic was written by me, styles and css files were taken from initial course files.
